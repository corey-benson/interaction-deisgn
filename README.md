# UX Designer Technical Test

## Problem Overview

* Use CSS to style the provided markup to create a clean, intuitive user experience.
* Fix any HTML that you may consider doesn't follow current best-practise guidelines
* Embellish the user experience using animation, interactions and updated process flows

## What We're Looking For

* Strong visual design
* Well implemented typography and vertical rhythm
* Clean CSS
* Clear user journey and interaction patterns
* Understanding of JavaScript implementation and ability to update where necessary

## Requirements

* The latest version of Chrome or Firefox

## Problem Details

This test is built on top of our demo API ([http://skybettechtestapi.herokuapp.com]()) which is used to pull in a list of available bets and submit stakes to place actual bets.

## Notes

Ideally, we want to see vanilla solutions so would prefer that existing frameworks (such as Bootstrap or Foundation) are not used. This does not include pre-processors, which can be used to enhance the writing of CSS if desired.

## Extra Credit

* Include brand elements to follow the design direction seen on [skybet.com]() and [m.skybet.com]()
* Include media queries to provide optimal experiences for devices of varying capabilities
* Enhance the JavaScript to give better feedback and introduce extra interaction touches
* Update the markup & CSS to introduce flexbox where appropriate
